abstract = {The Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF) provides a means to define (or present) logics.
It is based on a general treatment of syntax, rules, and proofs by means of a typed
λ-calculus with dependent types. Syntax is treated in a style similar to, but more
general than, Martin-Lo¨f's system of arities. The treatment of rules and proofs focuses
on his notion of a judgment. Logics are represented in LF via a new principle, the
judgments as types principle, whereby each judgment is identified with the type of
its proofs. This allows for a smooth treatment of discharge and variable occurence
conditions and leads to a uniform treatment of rules and proofs whereby rules are
viewed as proofs of higher-order judgments and proof checking is reduced to type checking.
The practical benefit of our treatment of formal systems is that logic-independent
tools, such as proof editors and proof checkers, can be constructed.},

abstract="The lambda-Pi-calculus allows to express proofs of minimal predicate logic. It can be extended, in a very simple way, by adding computation rules. This leads to the lambda-Pi-calculus modulo. We show in this paper that this simple extension is surprisingly expressive and, in particular, that all functional Pure Type Systems, such as the system F, or the Calculus of Constructions, can be embedded in it. And, moreover, that this embedding is conservative under termination hypothesis.",
